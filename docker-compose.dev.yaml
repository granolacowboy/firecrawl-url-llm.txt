# This file is for local development and overrides docker-compose.yaml
# to build services from local source code instead of using pre-built images.
#
# To use it, run:
# docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.dev.yaml up --build

services:
  playwright-service:
    build: apps/playwright-service-ts
    # This overrides the 'image' key in the main docker-compose.yaml

  api:
    build: apps/api
    # This overrides the 'image' key inherited from x-common-service

  worker:
    build: apps/api
    # This overrides the 'image' key inherited from x-common-service
